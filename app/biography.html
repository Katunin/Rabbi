                            A strong brand identity is crucial to the success of businesses big and small — and is one of your most valuable assets. In addition to differentiating your business from the competition, a strong brand identity creates a deep connection with existing customers and attracts new ones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Many businesses mistakenly overlook the value of a strong and consistent brand, assuming that because they aren’t the size of Nike or Apple that they’ll never acquire or retain customers based on their brand alone. Younger startups, small businesses, and companies that have limited resources are the ones that typically fall prey to this mindset. Initially, these companies can grow despite not having a brand strategy; however, there will come a point where leadership has to face the music and recognize that poor branding is holding their business back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leaders who aren’t familiar with marketing and branding strategies may underestimate the amount of preparation that is necessary if you hope to be successful with a rebrand. They may think the situation involves making a few changes to the logo, introducing some new talking points and finding new channels to disseminate your message, and then they’re all set! That’s when the harsh reality starts to set in and they realize, “This process is far more involved than I ever imagined.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Making the decision to rebrand should always have a business reason backing it up. Rebranding for the sake of rebranding will always be detrimental to your business. Why? There are always going to be customers who identify with aspects of your current brand — and see no need for things to change. Having a business reason behind your rebrand will help you plan for ways to introduce the new aspects of your brand without destroying what it is that draws your existing loyal customers to you in the first place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In certain cases, identifying a business reason for undergoing the rebranding process is clear (example: two companies merged). Other instances are not as transparent and require a bit more research and analysis into the rebranding strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you have identified a business reason for rebranding your business, you can move onto doing investigative research and conducting a thorough brand analysis.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The business reason for rebranding will influence they type of brand analysis you conduct. For example, if your business is rebranding because you are moving into a new market to compete with more established companies you should have a thorough understanding of both your competitors and how your potential customers connect with brands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the brand analysis, you may discover that only parts of your brand identity need refreshing — or you may learn that you need to completely overhaul your business’s brand. However, if you skip a thorough brand analysis, you won’t understand the depth of your business’s rebrand and risk alienating your existing customers and clients.
